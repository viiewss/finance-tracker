# Finance Tracker

This project is a basic setup for a finance tracker application built with Spring Boot.

## Features
- Spring Boot project structure with dependencies: Web, JPA, PostgreSQL, Security, Lombok, Flyway.
- Docker Compose configuration for a PostgreSQL database.
- `application.yml` prepared for local development.
- Placeholder migration script.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure Docker is installed and run `docker-compose up -d` to start PostgreSQL.
2. Build the project with Maven: `mvn spring-boot:run`.

This setup is intentionally minimal to serve as a starting point for learning Spring Boot and SQL.
